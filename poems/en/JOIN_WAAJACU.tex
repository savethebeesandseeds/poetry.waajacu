I'm still working on many things. For example, I was going to apply\\
 to your guild on a regular basis, but now 'we at my belonging \\
 foundation www.waajacu.com work to display effort on genetic research \\
 for south american native Tundra'. ---I wonder if you'd allow me \\
 sharing your work to by side finance my living and to share your \\
 development needs; in robotics, control, strategy, or well on computer bots, \\
 natural language understanding (bu every code is now solve by the \\
 magic of coding, so also you could have it be it)- I'll be performing \\
 reforestation during night and on your own foundation interest software \\
 development during day (not the other way arownd for I'm more \\
 passionate during night and effective during day, I just have until \\
 somehow not have many practical passions). ---I'll used to hope \\
 coding was practical, yet still it is, and needs to mine and hope \\
 code will do, so every code I'll develop it as versatile of a framework\\
  as I can, and so we could share both interest and benefits, \\
  and share widely the whole of it if we see. \\!

%------------------------------------------------

---allow me to introduce my self as waajacu. ---we waajacu, could be \\
also be with you, all of you are invited to join also, we in respect \\
to algorithms work on symbols, for we think i'll bring the most. we \\
build on with caution on necessary efforts, but none waajacu is \\
possible with out it also belonging so to other alike-waajacu \\
fundations, as i'll belive your to be. \\!
